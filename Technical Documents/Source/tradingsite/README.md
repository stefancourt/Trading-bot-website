## 🧪 Executing Test Suites

To execute the test suites for the TradeIT application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are within the application's virtual environment.
2. Locate the tests using the **pytest** framework within each separate app, including backend, frontend, and database tests.
3. Run the tests for a specific app by entering the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pytest <app>
```

Replace `<app>` with the name of the app whose tests you want to run. For example:

```bash
pytest trade
```

The output, including test results and any error messages, will be displayed in the terminal.
